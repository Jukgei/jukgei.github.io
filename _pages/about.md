Hi! I am a passionate and self-motivated researcher. Currently, I am working as a research assistant at the [RAPID Lab](http://lab.sysu-robotics.com) of [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). Previously, I was a game developer at [NetEase Games](https://www.neteasegames.com). I received my master degree at Sun Yat-sen University, advised by Prof. [Hui Cheng](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2504).

### Interests
- 3D Reconstruction
- (Differentiable) Physical Simulation
- Sim-to-Real (Robotics)

My dream is to conduct interesting and valuable research that closes the gap between virtual reality and physical reality.

<font color="red"><b>I am currently seeking research assistant or Ph.D. opportunities for the 2024/2025 academic year.</b></font>
